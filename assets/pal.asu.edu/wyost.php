Research in the Psychoacoustics Laboratory is concerned mostly with the way in which the auditory system 
processes temporally dynamic or time-varying sounds. This research has implications for the way in which we 
perceive sounds such as speech and music. Recent research also has focused on the perceptual consequences of 
a form of amplitude compression that is observed in the cochlea of the inner ear. Most of the research in the 
laboratory focuses on auditory processing by individuals with normal hearing, where the goal is to understand 
basic aspects of hearing and to relate the behavioral results to underlying physiology. A considerable amount 
of research also addresses the effects of cochlear hearing loss on auditory perception. The goals of this 
research are to understand the limitations imposed by hearing loss and to provide a strong basis for the 
development of signal-processing strategies for assistive-listening devices such as hearing aids. Finally, 
some of the research in the laboratory is concerned with how the normal aging process affects the perception 
of sound. This research is motivated by the general trouble that older individuals have understanding speech, 
particularly in difficult listening situations, and the importance of communication to the well being of those 
individuals.
