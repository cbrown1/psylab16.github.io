    The lab is equipped with two double-walled sound booths, each with custom benchtops, and enough space to seat 
    two listeners comfortably. The headphones and button boxes at each experimental station are controlled by 
    rack-mounted Tucker Davis Technologies hybrid (system II & 3) systems. The racks also contain various calibration 
    and measurement equipment, including two

    digital storage oscilloscopes, two digital spectrum analyzers, and various other eqipment, including programmable 
    attenuators and filters. A precision digital sound level meter with headphone coupler is also available, as well 
    as an audiometer. <br><br>
    Each TDT rack system is controlled by a pc running custom software written for the Matlab environment. The software
    provides programmatic control over stimulus generation and presentation, feedback, and data collection and real-time
    analysis. Each pc/rack system can independently control the two stations in each corresponding booth, meaning a total 
    of four listeners can be run concurrently.<br><br>
    There is an additional pc equipped with a high-quality sound card located just outside one of the booths. A keyboard,
    mouse, monitor, and headphone connection inside the booth provide a suitable environment for pilot listening.
